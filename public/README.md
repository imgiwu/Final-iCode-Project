# iCode-Project

My First Project

This is an experimental e-commerce landing page project for iCode study program using a combine ideas collected from Stack Overflow, W3Schools and Bootstrap with some helpful suggestions and advice from professional developer through Stack Overflow FAQ page, all consolidated into one framework. 

To learned and create a responsive landing page motivates me to come up with this gadget friendly website project.

I build this project to show how grateful I am and show my appreciation to TIES, ComIT and Gov’t of Alberta for this wonderful web development iCode study program.

This is an exciting and special project because this is a lesson learned experienced for me, since this project is a collection of collective ideas that I compiled in one framework and I injected it with my own code and styling as well. 

On this project I experienced so many coding fault and this experiences teaches me how to improved myself and learn how to debug and find solution to every errors that shows in the browser.

I considered this as a hybrid type of project because the ideas came from multiple sources that I compiled in one framework and tweak it.

I’m proud to come up with this project because it’s a gadget friendly, a responsive website that can be viewed on smart phone, tablet, iPad, laptop and desktop.
